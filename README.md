# combining_MySQL_and_Tableau

MySQL was used throughout this course with the IED MySQL Workbench. Tableau Public was used for data visualization.

All of the Tableau visualizaitons can be found under my profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/steven2028#!/
NOTE: some of these vizzes are interactive. Therefore, I recommend visiting my profile to get the most out of them.

Here are the business questions from the final tasks:

Task 1: Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

Task 3: Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.
