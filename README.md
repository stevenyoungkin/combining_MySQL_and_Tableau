# combining_MySQL_and_Tableau

MySQL was used throughout this course with the IED MySQL Workbench. Tableau Public was used for data visualization.

All of the Tableau visualizaitons can be found under my profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/steven2028#!/
A dashboard with all tasks can be found at https://public.tableau.com/profile/steven2028#!/vizhome/dashboard_all_tasks/Dashboard1
NOTE: to give more insight, vizzes are interactive. 

Here are the business questions from the final tasks:

Task 1: Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

Task 3: Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

Task 4: Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure. Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
