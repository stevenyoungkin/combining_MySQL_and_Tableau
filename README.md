# combining_MySQL_and_Tableau

MySQL was used throughout this course with the IED MySQL Workbench. Tableau Public was used for data visualization.

All of the Tableau visualizaitons can be found under my profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/steven2028#!/

Here are the business questions from the final tasks:

Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
